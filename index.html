            <h2>The Problem with Consent in Romantic Comedies</h2>

            <p style="padding-top: 2em;"><em>Content warning: themes of consent and sexual assualt.</em></p>
            <p>The movie scene is all too familiar. A boy grabs an unsuspecting girl by the waist and leans in for a kiss.
                The music swells as he plants his lips on hers. They break apart, laugh, and the film ends in a cheesy
                wedding montage.</p>
            <p>But what if, as she slowly steps back, her face is filled with fear, not love? Not your typical rom-com scene
                is it?</p>
            <p>From the silver screen to computer screens, romantic comedies have defined us in many ways.
                Whether it's our relationships or even our secret fantasies,
                these stories affect the way we perceive attraction and love. And while our hearts yearn for the
                protagonists to find each other,
                we often turn a blind eye to the complex and messy actions that come in between, including consent.
                A closer look into ten of our favorite rom-coms reveal that some of our previous notions of “love,”
                aren't actually love at all. </p>
            <p>While legal definitions of consent vary, the concept is always the same. Consent is a clear and freely
                communicated agreement between participants to engage in sexual activity. If it has been coerced out of
                someone, it is not consent.</p>
            <p>Planned Parenthood's FRIES acronym specifies five measureable components needed to establish consent.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fries-def">
            <p style="color: #C20879;"><strong style="color:black">F</strong> - Freely Given. You agreed at your own free
                will, devoid of coercion.<br><br>
                <strong style="color:black">R</strong> - Reversible. You can decide to stop or retract consent given earlier
                at any time.<br><br>
                <strong style="color:black">I</strong> - Informed. You know what is going down before, during, and
                after.<br><br>
                <strong style="color:black">E</strong> - Enthusiastic. Only “yes” means “yes.” If you're uncertain or
                hesitant in any way, stop.<br><br>
                <strong style="color:black">S</strong> - Specific. Be clear about what your boundaries are.<br>

                <strong style="color:black">R</strong> = Yes. Though the interaction was instigated without his consent,
                Jacob could have pulled back and ended the encounter rather than reciprocating.<br><br>

                yell his name, and then kiss him in front of everyone. <br><br>

                To score these ten movies, we noted every consent-related scene and then 
                scored those scenes against the FRIES model (we wrote “yes” 
                if that scene fit the definition and “no” if not). 
                Then we divided the number of yeses over the total number of scenes 
                for each FRIES letter to get their scores.

        <p>Put up against a range of movies over time, the question of consent on screen never seems to go away. In fact, it
            even plays out in the same common “romantic” tropes. And although these tropes have continued to narrate rom-com
            romance, they often conflict with new attitudes in society. From running after each other on the train to
            standing in the rain, we chose to watch — and in some cases rewatch — ten romantic comedies from the past 40
            years to see how the movies that have defined our popular culture measure up to the FRIES test.</p>

                While it may seem romantic to catch the eye of a powerful individual,
                relationships where one partner has leverage can lay the grounds for coercion.
                An unequal power dynamic encompasses an imbalance in age, finances, or institutional position,
                thus the office is a common setting for sexual harassment. People who reject the advances of higher-ups
                risk victim blaming, developing a reputation for trouble, and being fired from the company.
                In short, saying no should be the easy answer but not when your coveted, high-paying job is on the
                line.
            </p>
            <p>Romantic comedies, like "Bridget Jones' Diary", often romanticize this trope as an unattainable love.
                In this scene, after months of sending flirty emails, Bridget's publisher, Daniel,
                gropes her in the elevator. The film portrays this as a welcomed gesture, a sign of his
                romantic reciprocation, and the start of their affair. While Bridget enjoys the interaction
                with her supervisor on-screen, many women might not off-screen.</p>
            <p>In 2017, women empowered each other through the #MeToo movement to
                speak out about their sexual harassment and assault experiences, especially in the workplace.
                Over 14 million tweets with the hashtag led to firings worldwide, new HR procedures,
                education on sexual harassment, and legal protection for victims. In its first year,
                more than 425 prominent figures, such as Film Producer Harvey Weinstein and
                Journalist Bill O' Reilly, were publicly accused of sexual misconduct.
                The movement has led to a culture of accountability for predators and aid for survivors,
                promising progress from the exhaustive questioning of the past which led so many victims to
                remain silent. If Bridget were to have these resources, maybe she wouldn't
                have had her whirlwind romance, but she'd also still have her job.

            <p>We often think there's no obstacle to love, but what if the obstacle is repeated rejection?
                Romantic comedies often exalt this relentless pursuit as the truest expression of love.
                And while there's something to be said for continued devotion in relationships, ruthless pursuit is
                alarming.
            </p>
            <p>In “What Women Want,” “suave” protagonist Nick is known for getting into anyone's bed,
                even those of the women who initially deny him — women like his local barista, Lola.
                Despite her repeated spurning, he continues to woo her with unwanted advances,
                even holding her hand on the counter before she whips it away. Like most rom-coms,
                Nick succeeds in winning her affection — a result that seemingly erases Lola's previous
                rejections.
            </p>
            <p>Though the other characters laud Nick's behavior,
                he actually undermines the choices of the women he chases.
                This behavior also appears in other films. In “Love Actually,”
                a man shows up unannounced in front of a girl's house in
                order to convince her to date him. In “Crazy, Stupid, Love,”
                a boy continually harrasses his babysitter (and crush) to the point of an
                embarrassing public display of affection. For each of them, a kiss at the end of the
                film is used to subvert stalking into vulnerability. But this doesn't
                necessarily translate off-screen.
            </p>
            <p>“I have been in relationships with guys who won't relent, and that's
                something shown in rom-coms where it proves you're into them, but it's actually harassment,”
                said Apoorva Verghese, a junior at Tulane University. “Now being in college,
                that behavior is creepy.”
            </p>
            <p>The inability to accept a woman's choice often has dire consequences.
                According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, about
                one in six women have <a
                    href=https://ncadv.org/blog/posts/quick-guide-to-stalking-16-important-statistics-and-what-you-can-do-about-it>experienced</a>
                stalking in their lifetimes.
                In addition, 81% of women who were stalked by a current or former partner
                were also physically assaulted.
            </p>
            <p>Relentless pursuit can lead to emotional, mental, and even physical trauma. Not only
                do rom-coms encourage this behavior, they reward it.
                The guy always ends up getting the girl, feeding into the idea that
                it's cute — and not dangerous — to try and ask for that date one more time.

            <p>Whether it's nervousness or anxiety,
                characters like Elle from “The Kissing Booth” often
                like to express every thought that crosses their mind.
                While a friend would allow them to ramble, a romantic partner takes it
                upon themselves to silence the character with a kiss.
            </p>
            <p>
                A defining trait of most rom-coms,
                the “shut up” kiss is supposed to be seen as endearing; a satisfying culmination to the
                palpable tension between two characters. The girl is so nervous that she can't stop talking,
                so the confident guy comes in to save her from herself. In reality, this action invalidates the
                informed aspect of consent. Whether or not the character's heart is in the right place, the
                “surprise factor” assumes that the other individual
                would consent before, during, and after the kiss, never giving them a chance to change their mind.
            </p>
            <p>According to journalist Kathleen Walsh's <a
                    href=https://www.instyle.com/politics-social-issues/andrew-cuomo-forced-kissing-sexual-assault>article</a>
                “Why Do Men Think Unwanted Kissing Is OK?,”
                movies like these contribute to the idea that an unwanted kiss
                isn't a direct form of assault. Our public consciousness associates
                their kiss with a sense of innocence and an idea of romance;
                we are supposed to applaud the perpetrator's boldness and swoon with the victim.
            </p>
            <p>As Walsh writes, “...we connote kissing with emotion, not aggression.”
                As a result, the audience subconsciously shifts the blame onto the victim.
                By perpetuating the narrative that the victim could have stopped the kiss,
                the gesture doesn't seem like that big of a deal. However, as long as these scenes are portrayed,
                rom-coms will continue to perpetuate a cycle of faulty romantic standards.

            <p>In this scene, 15-year-old Ted misinterprets his peer Sam's
                cordiality as a sign of flirting,
                so he suddenly moves to straddle Sam and tries to kiss her.
                Sam laughs, potentially
                indicating to the audience that she doesn't feel threatened by his move.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, even after Sam rejects him once,
                Ted attempts to do the same thing again.
                He misinterprets her “it's okay” comment as permission to initiate another kiss.
                In doing so, Ted has established a false narrative that Sam has permitted him to act.
            </p>
            <p>Although this may have appeared lighthearted on-screen,
                this interaction would spark much concern off-screen.
            </p>
            <p> According to RAINN, the nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization,
                “consenting to one activity, one time,
                does not mean someone gives consent for other activities or for the same
                activity on other occasions.”
            </p>
            <p> Though Sam consented to talking about her romantic life with Ted,
                it doesn't give him permission to initiate romantic activities with her.
                Rather than making a move without a word from Sam,
                Ted should have initiated a conversation with her.
                Both of them should've talked about what they were comfortable with and what
                they were consenting to, before it happened.

                <p>As Noah utters the words “you leave me no choice,”
                    he does more than just hang off a ferris wheel;
                    Noah backs Allie into a corner via emotional manipulation.
                    His safety is no longer a matter determined by Allie's free will,
                    rather, it is a manipulation of power by Noah preying on her fear.
                    Not only does Noah place Allie in an uncomfortable position,
                    he also does so shamelessly in front of her date and friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to the organization <a
                        href=https://www.loveisrespect.org/resources/what-is-sexual-coercion>Love is Respect</a>,
                    coercion should be thought of as a spectrum or range
                    “...vary(ing) from someone verbally egging you on to someone actually
                    forcing you to have contact with them.
                    It can be verbal and emotional,
                    in the form of statements that make you feel pressure, guilt or shame.”
                </p>
                <p>Coercion and informed consent are mutually exclusive.
                    In Noah's case, denying Allie's attempts to say no
                    and pushing his own wants ahead of her emotional needs removes her
                    ability to provide consent.
                </p>
                <p>If that wasn't enough,
                    Noah then asks Allie to repeat herself to the point of begging;
                    she has to scream “I want to go out with you!”
                    just so he can put two hands on the bar.
                    It isn't just the act of persistence that causes harm in this scene,
                    but the given romantic context. Noah pressures Allie to go on a date with him; an act that should be
                    consensual.
                    This shows that context, surroundings, and language all play
                    important factors when we talk about consent.

            <p>These are expressions women often hear when they speak up about harassment.
                Consent is a real issue that has real repercussions on real relationships.
                Yet, 40 years and countless social movements later, the way we depict consent on
                screen hasn't changed.
            </p>
            <p>To evaluate whether a film depicted relationships consensually,
                we divided their individual FRIES scores by the number of scenes of consent.
                This gave us our “consent score.” Five represents a perfect score,
                meaning that a film's scenes are consensual.
                One would be the worst score, meaning that the film did not depict any consent at all.

                From 1980 to 2020, we see that the consent score jumps up and down.
                Instead of an upward trend of healthy depictions of consent, movies
                like “Two Night Stand” and “The First Time,” as exceptions to the standard.
                Without healthy portrayals of consent, audiences are lead to believe certain unconsensual behaviors are okay.
            </p>
            <p>
                When “romantic” encounters diminish the severity of harassment and assault,
                we see a generation growing up with a mixed understanding of what a healthy
                relationship looks like. Media and movies are not for purely entertainment purposes.
                Audiences should be able to assume that the values they see on screen are reflective
                of ones in daily life, and consent is a major part of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                We must also acknowledge that the movies chosen are based on Western depictions of
                romance through a heterosexual lens. The unlearned lessons from these rom-coms
                increase when we forget to introduce inclusive narratives.

                <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/business/netflix-2022-lineup.html>Netflix</a> is set to release
                at least 61 films in 2022 alone, but what about other
                production companies? As more movies are made and as people continue to look
                toward the screens, we forget that media has the power to shape society into the
                world we envision. As the romantic comedy genre continues to grow,
                so should our depictions of consent.

                    based on writer preferences and time of relevance.
                    Movies were split between reviewers and rated using Planned Parenthood's FRIES criteria for consent.
                    Each romantic gesture was recorded along with a violation for each criteria.
                    The final number of violations for each criteria was then averaged for each
                    film to determine the overall compliance with sexual consent standards.

                    Here is how we calculated the “Consent Score”: 
                    We watched each movie and time stamped every consent-related scene.
                    We scored those scenes against the FRIES model (we wrote “yes” if that scene fit the definition and “no” if not).
                    For each letter, we divided the number of yeses over the total number of scenes.
                    We added those averages together to get a movie's consent score. 
                    We did this for every movie and mapped them out to get the graphic above.
